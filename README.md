# Ulam Spiral Toy

A website for exploring the 
[Ulam spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral).
Inspired by Jacob Yatsko's video 
[Extending Ulam Beyond Primes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inrYsAusfPg").

Each circle on the spiral represents an integer, starting at 1 in the center, 
and increasing outwards.
This tool lets you colour in numbers, and draw lines in different ways.
The "classic" colouring has the primes coloured in black, shown by default.
